# pull
It's like a fetch using XMLHttpRequest.

# Why is it called pull?

Originally it was supposed to call fillinAJAX because it is kinda off a polyfill to the fetch API.
When I'm going to git push I first do git pull, I remembered that when you do git pull it does first git fetch.
So that's it, when I do pull I fetch.
