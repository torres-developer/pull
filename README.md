# polypull

It's like a fetch using XMLHttpRequest.

# Why is it called polypull?

Originally it was supposed to call fillinAJAX because it is kinda off a
polyfill to the fetch API. When I'm going to git push I first do git pull, I
remembered that when you do git pull it does first git fetch. So that's it,
when I do pull I fetch.

The name pull was taken on npm so now it's called polypull
